# THE UPSIDE DOWN HOUSE

The Upside Down House is an attraction in Niagara Falls constructed and built by Marek Cyran with help from Daniel Czapiewski, two creative Polish men. The Upside Down House is upside down from the outside to the inside, this house looks as if it has been literally picked up and placed on itâ€™s roof. It is a great place to visit.

The Upside Down House is open seven days of the week and it will be hard to miss when you are driving along Clifton Hill. The Upside Down House is open to the public. Children under four are free.

On Clifton Hill in Niagara Falls kitsch is king and among the newest attractions clustered on Clifton Hill is the Upside Down House, also known as the Whoopsy House depending on who you ask. This attraction has a greater summertime appeal and is walking distance away from the Clifton Hill area.

Disorient yourself in Niagara Falls. This dizzy destination is both flipped and crooked, the floor will leave you wondering how far you need to tilt to stay straight. The disorientation continues as your group parades through this unique attraction. The Upside Down House is open with current hours available on their Facebook page. As a bonus to families children under four have free admission.

Visit this attraction during the summer months for the best experience. Remember to check times and rates on their Facebook page, which acts in place of a website.


# WonderWorks - Museum

WonderWorks is an entertainment center focused on science exhibits with five locations in the United States. The company's slogan is "Let Your Imagination Run Wild". Its buildings are commonly built as if they are upside down. The experience is considered an "edu-tainment", a combination of education and entertainment. It contains over one hundred hands on exhibits that challenges the mind and many activities for guests to explore.

Each WonderWorks location contains interactive, entertainment exhibits on the themes of space, physics, and math. Some locations also offer a dinner magic show, as well as a 4D XD motion theater. Each WonderWorks building is designed to look as if an existing building was ripped free of the ground by severe weather and dropped upside down on its roof. This unique design was originally brought to life by architect and Orlando native Terry O. Nichoson of Nichoson Design International at WonderWorks' original Orlando location.

The legend of WonderWorks begins with the world's greatest scientists led by professor Wonder. Their top secret research laboratory located on a remote island in the Bermuda Triangle was the site for their latest experiment, creating a man made tornado. The experiment goes wrong and the tornado is unleashed into the laboratory, removing it from the ground and carrying it thousands of miles away until it lands upside down onto the current locations.
